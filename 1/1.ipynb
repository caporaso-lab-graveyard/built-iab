Students from varied disciplines (e.g., biology, computer science, statistics, and biochemistry) and stages of their educational careers (undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral) are becoming interested in bioinformatics."

    "*An **I**ntroduction to **A**pplied **B**ioinformatics*, or **IAB**, is an open source, interactive bioinformatics text. **It introduces readers to the core concepts of bioinformatics in the context of their implementation and application to real-world problems and data.** IAB is closely tied to the [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org) python package, which provides production-ready implementations of core bioinformatics algorithms and data structures. Readers therefore learn the concepts in the context of tools they can use to develop their own bioinformatics software and pipelines, enabling them to rapidly get started on their own projects. While some theory is discussed, the focus of IAB is on what readers need to know to be effective, practicing bioinformaticians."

And, because IAB is presented as an IPython Notebook, readers can execute the code directly in the text. For example, when learning pairwise alignment, users can align sequences provided in IAB (or their own sequences) and modify parameters (or even the algorithm itself) to see how changes affect the resulting alignments."

    "I have degrees in Computer Science (B.S., University of Colorado, 2001) and Biochemistry (B.A., University of Colorado, 2004; Ph.D., University of Colorado 2009). Following my formal training, I joined the [Rob Knight Laboratory](http://knightlab.ucsd.edu), then at the University of Colorado, for approximately 2 years as a post-doctoral scholar. In 2011, I joined the faculty at [Northern Arizona University (NAU)](www.nau.edu) where I'm an Assistant Professor in the Biological Sciences department. I [teach](http://www.caporasolab.us/teaching/) one course per year in bioinformatics for graduate and undergraduate students of Biology and Computer Science. I also run a [research lab](http://www.caporasolab.us/) in the [Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics](http://www.mggen.nau.edu/), which is focused on developing bioinformatics software and studying the human microbiome."

    "I'm not the world expert on the topics that I present in IAB, but I have a passion for bioinformatics, open source software, writing, and education. When I'm learning a new bioinformatics concept, for example an algorithm like pairwise alignment or a statistical technique like Monte Carlo simulation, implementing it is usually the best way for me to wrap my head around it. This led me to start developing IAB, as I found that my implementations helped my students learn the concepts too. I think that one of my strongest skills is the ability to break complex ideas into accessible components. I do this well for bioinformatics because I remember (and still regularly experience) the challenges of learning it, so can relate to newcomers in the field."

    "I'm very active in open source bioinformatics software development. I am most widely known for my involvement in the development of the [QIIME software package](http://www.qiime.org), and more recently for leading the development of [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org). I am also involved in many other bioinformatics software projects (see my [GitHub page](http://github.com/gregcaporaso)). IAB is one of the projects that I'm currently most excited about, so I truly hope that it's as useful for you as it is fun for me."
