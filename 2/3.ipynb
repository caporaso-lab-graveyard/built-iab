For example, if you are trying to gain insight on the evolutionary relationships between all of the 16S bacterial genes in a given sample, it would be time consuming and very inefficient to compare them two at a time. It would be more efficient and useful to compare all of the 16S sequences from the bacteria in the same alignment.\n",
