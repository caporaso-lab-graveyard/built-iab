    "The process of searching a set of sequences against a reference database to find their best match is typically referred to a **sequence mapping**. One example of this would be in *genome re-sequencing*. If you're searching for polymorphisms in the human genome that may be associated with a phenotype (e.g., a particular disease) you might begin by sequencing the full human genome. Because the human genome has been fully sequenced and (mostly) assembled, you could map your short sequence reads against the full human genome, and then search for loci (or co-located sets of one or more bases) that vary with the phenotype of interest. Because this process is generally performed with DNA sequencing reads, you may also hear it referred to as *read mapping*."

    "A similar process can be applied if there is no reference database to search against. In this case, sequences will be grouped together based on their similarity to one another. This is most often applied to reads of a single gene or locus across the genomes of many different organisms. This process is referred to as **de novo sequence clustering**, and one field where this is common is **microbiomics**, or the study of whole communities of microorganisms. Because we don't know how to culture the vast majority of microbes, most of what we know about the composition of microbial communities (e.g., in free-living environments, such as the ocean, soil, or surfaces in our homes or offices, or in host-associated environments, such as the human gut) is based on sequencing specific marker genes such as the 16S rRNA from all community members. If we obtain a large number of sequence reads, many of the things we want to do with them (such as identify their taxonomic origin, or understand where they fall in a phylogenetic tree) is too computationally intensive to achieve. So instead, we group sequences that are identicial or highly similar in composition into **Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)**, and we choose a single representative of that OTU to work with downstream. For example, if we have a group of 16S rRNA reads that are within 97% identity to one member of that cluster (the cluster centroid) we may assume that the taxonomic origin of the cluster centroid is the same as the taxonomic origin of all of the sequences in the group. This is an *assumption* - it may or may not be true - but it is a necessary evil given the current technology."

    "Another application of grouping similar sequences (or **OTU clustering**, or **OTU picking**, as it is sometimes referred to) is in grouping sequences in a database before investigating them, to reduce taxonomic bias in the database. For example, *E. coli* is one of the most heavily sequenced microbes. If you're interested in understanding the frequency of variants of a specific gene across a range of microbial diversity, you might begin by obtatining all sequences of that gene from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Because there may be many more *E. coli* sequences, purely because of sequencing bias, you'd likely want to group your sequences into OTUs before computing variant frequencies, so your calculations are not biased toward the frequencies in *E. coli*, as hundreds of E. coli sequences would likely group to one or a few closely related OTUs. In other words, you're trying to find a **divergent set** of sequences to work with (and an [aptly named tool](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16769708) was published in 2006 to automate this process)."

In an ideal world, we would perform a full multiple sequence alignment of all of our sequences, compute their pairwise similarities (or dissimilarities), and use those values to group sequences that are above some *similarity threshold* into *OTU clusters* (just *OTUs* from here). As we discussed in the mutliple sequence alignment chapter however, that is infeasible for more than a few tens of sequences due to computational and memory requirements. Even progressive alignment can't typically handle more than a few tens of thousands of sequences (at least with the currently available implementations, that I am aware of), so OTU clustering is generally acheived by picking pairs of sequences to align. You'll notice in this section that many of the heuristics that have been applied for speeding up database searching are similar to the heuristics applied for OTU clustering."

This is a very widely applied protocol, and the primary function of popular bioinformatics tools such as [cdhit](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/23/3150.long) and [uclust](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/19/2460.long). Another category of OTU clustering protocols is also popular however: reference-based OTU clustering, where a external reference database of sequences is used to aid in cluster defintion."

From here, reference-based clustering is performed in one of two ways. In *closed-reference* OTU clustering, the set of centroids is static, and sequenences that don't match a centroid are not clustered. In *open-reference* OTU clustering, the set of centroids can expand: sequences that don't match an existing centroid can become new centroid sequences."
