Homology searching is an essential part of making inferences about where a biological sequence came from, and/or what it does.

    "In the context of database searching, a query sequence and a reference sequence that we hypothesize to be homologous can be identical to one another, or they can differ as a result of mutation events. When sequences differ, we're often then interested in how much they differ, or their pairwise similarity, which can help us identify the most closely related of several homologs in the reference database. There is an important distinction in the terms *homology* and *similarity*: homology is a discrete variable, and similarity is a continuous variable. A pair of biological sequences either *are* or *are not* derived from a common ancestor, but they can be more or less similar to each other. Saying that two sequences are 80% homologous doesn't make sense. What people generally mean when they say this is that two sequences are 80% similar, and as a result they are hypothesizing homology between the sequences."

You could alternatively reduce the number of reference sequences, but you might run into the same issues there: we wouldn't want to exclude reference sequences that might provide us with useful information about our query sequences. Finally, we might be able to figure out some ways to perform fewer alignments by not searching all of the query sequences against all of the reference sequences. If we could come up with some procedure to approximate which pairwise alignments were likely to be good (i.e., high scoring) and which were likely to be bad (i.e., low scoring) that is faster than performing the pairwise alignments, we could apply that procedure and only align a pair of sequences when we expect to get a high score.

As our number of query sequences increases because we are able to obtain more for the same amount of money, or the size of our reference databases increases (because we're continuously obtaining more sequence data) this will increasing become a problem.

An algorithm developer could therefore improve runtime by defining a heuristic (or a rule) that is applied to determine which reference sequences are likely to result in good alignments, and only aligning the query against those. For it to be useful, making the decision to align or not (i.e., applying the heurtistic) must be *much faster* than actually performing the pairwise alignment. The heuristic also needs to make *good* choices about which reference sequences to align the query against. If the algorithm chooses to not align against a specific query, that query is ruled out as a possible result of the database search. A good heuristic for sequence homology searching therefore makes it very unlikely to exclude the best alignment(s).

Our method detected that homology for `sequence1_95`, when we simulated very closely related sequences, but not for ``sequence1_25``, when we simulated much more distantly related sequences. This gives us an idea of the limit of detection of this method, and is a real-world problem that biologists face: as sequences are more divergent from one another, detecting homology becomes increasingly difficult."
