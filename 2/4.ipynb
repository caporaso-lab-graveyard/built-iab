    "Reconstructing the phylogeny of a group of individuals is useful for many reasons. Probably the most obvious of these is understanding the evolutionary relationship between a group of organisms. For example, over the past half-century we've gained great insight into the evolution of our species, *Homo sapiens*, by studying features of our closest relatives, both extant (still existing) organisms, such as the *Pan* (chimpanzees) and *Gorilla* genera, and extinct (no longer living) species, including *Homo neanderthalensis*, *Homo erectus*, *Homo habilus*, and many species in the *Australopithecus* genus. (The [Smithsonian Museum's Human Origins Initiative](http://humanorigins.si.edu/) is an excellent resource for learning more about the fascinating subject of human evolution.) In this time, we've also improved our understanding of the deeper branches in the tree of life. For example, [Woese and Fox (1977)](http://www.pnas.org/content/74/11/5088.full.pdf) used phylogenetic reconstruction to first illustrate that the \"prokaryotes\" really represented two ancient lineages which they called the eubacteria and the archaebacteria, which ultimately led to the proposal of a \"three domain\" tree of life composed of the three deep branching linages, the archaea, the bacteria, and the eucarya ([Woese, Kandler and Wheelis (1990)](http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576.full.pdf))."

    "The *individuals* represented at the tips of our trees don't necessarily have to be organisms though. In another important application of phylogenetic trees, we can study the evolution of genes, which can help us gain a deeper understanding of gene function. Specifically, we can learn about families of related genes. A classic example of this is the globin family, which includes the proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin, molecules that can reversibly bind oxygen (meaning they can bind to it, and then let go of it). You've probably heard of hemoglobin (if not globins in general), as this molecule binds to oxygen where it is present in high concentration (such as in your lung) and releases it where it is present in low concentration (such as in the bicep, where it is ultimately used to power your arm). Hemoglobin and myoglobin are paralogs, meaning that they are related by a gene duplication and subsequent divergence. If you were to compare an unknown globin sequence to either of these you could detect homology, but a tree such as the one present in Figure 2, would help you understand the type of homologous relationship (i.e., whether it was orthology or paralogy)."

    "As an example, let's consider the reconstruction of the phylogeny of spiders (the order Araneae), a hypothesis of which is presented in Figure 3. Of the extant spiders, some are orb-weavers (meaning they spin circular, sticky webs), and others are not. Entomologists have debated whether orb-weaving is a monophyletic trait (meaning that it evolved one time), or whether it is polyphyletic (meaning that it evolved multiple times, such as flight, which has evolved independently in birds, flying dinosaurs, insects, and mammals). If orb-weaving is monophyletic, it would mean that over the course of evolution, extant spiders which don't weave orb webs have lost that ability. Some researchers doubt this as it's a very effective means of catching prey, and losing that ability would likely constitute an evolutionary disadvantage. If orb-weaving is polyphyletic, it would means that in at least two different spider lineages, this trait arose independently, which other researchers consider to be very unlikely due to the complexity of engineering these webs. Examples of the evolution of monophyletic and polyphyletic traits are presented in Figures 3 and 4, respectively."

    "Earlier work on understanding the relations between the spider lineages focused on comparing traits that entomologists would observe, for example by watching spiders in action or by dissecting them. For example, in 1986 through 1991, [Johnathan Coddington](http://entomology.si.edu/StaffPages/coddington.html) published several studies that tabulated and compared about sixty features of 32 spider taxa (Coddington J. 1986. The monophyletic origin of the orb web. In: Shear W, ed. Spiders: webs, behavior, and evolution. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. 319-363; Coddington JA. 1991. Cladistics and spider classification: araneomorph phylogeny and the monophyly of orbweavers (Araneae: Araneomorphae; Orbiculariae) Acta Zoologica Fennica 190:75-87). Features included whether a spider wraps its prey when it attacks (a behavioral trait), and how branched the spider's trachea is (a morphological trait). By determining which spiders were more similar and different across these traits, Dr. Coddington provided early evidence for the hypothesis that orb-weaving is an ancient monophyletic trait."

    "More recently, several research teams have used features of spider genomes to reconstruct the spider phylogeny (<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00750-7\">Bond et al., 2014</a>, [Garrison et al., 2016](https://peerj.com/articles/1719/)). Using this approach, the features become the nucleotides observed at particular positions in the genome, which are observed first by sequencing specific genes that the researchers target that are present in all members of the group, and then aligning those sequences with multiple sequence alignment. This has several advantages over feature matrices derived from morphological and behavioral traits, including that many more features can be observed. For example, ([Garrison et al., 2016](https://peerj.com/articles/1719/)), compared approximately 700,000 amino acid positions from nearly 4000 loci around the genomes of 70 spider taxa. Compare the number of features here to the number mentioned in the previous paragraph. These *phylogenomic* studies have further supported the idea that orb-weaving is an ancient monophyletic trait, and have provided much finer scale information on the evolution of spiders. Supported by these data, researchers hypothesize that the loss of orb-weaving might not be that surprising. While it does provide an effective means of catching flying insects, many insects which are potential prey for spiders don't fly. Further, orb webs may attract predators of spiders, as they are easily observable signals of where a spider can be found."

For example, in the simulation above, we assume that the rate of substitution mutations doesn't change in different parts of our phylogeny. Imagine in the real-world that the environment changed drastically for some descendants (for example, if a geological event created new thermal vents in a lake they inhabited, resulting in an increase in mean water temperature), but not for others. The descendants who experience the environmental change might have an increased rate of substitutions as their genomes adapt to the new environment.

For this reason, you always want to understand what assumptions a simulation is making, and consider those when determining how confident you are in the results of an evaluation based on simulation.
