Like many of the measures that are used in microbial community ecology, it wasn't initially designed for studying microbial communities, but rather communities of \"macro-organisms\" (macrobes?). Some of these metrics, including PD, do translate well to microbial community analysis, while some don't translate as well. (For an illustration of the effect of sequencing error on PD, where it is handled well, versus it's effect on the Chao1 metric, where it is handled less well, see Figure 1 of [Reeder and Knight (2010)](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n9/full/nmeth0910-668b.html))."

If we collect 100 sequences from one sample, and 10,000 sequences from another sample, we can't directly compare the number of observed OTUs or the phylogenetic diversity of these because we expended a lot more sampling effort on the sample with 10,000 sequences than on the sample with 100 sequences. The way this is typically handled is by randomly subsampling sequences from the sample with more sequences until the sequencing depth is equal to that in the sample with fewer sequences. If we randomly select 100 sequences at random from the sample with 10,000 sequences, and compute the alpha diversity based on that random subsample, we'll have a better idea of the relative alpha diversities of the two samples."

The basic idea behind oridination is dimensionality reduction: we want to take high-dimensionality data (a distance matrix) and represent that in a few (usually two or three) dimensions. As humans, we're very bad at interpreting high dimensionality data directly: with ordination, we can take an $n$-dimensional data set (e.g., a distance matrix of shape $n \\times n$, representing the distances between $n$ biological samples) and reduce that to a 2-dimensional scatter plot similar to that presented in panels A-D above."

Possibly the most simple ordination technique is one called Polar Ordination. Polar Ordination is not widely applied because it has some incovenient features, but I find that it is useful for introducing the idea behind ordination. Here we'll work through a simple implementation of ordination to illustrate the process, which will help us to interpret ordination plots. In practice, you will use existing software, such as [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org)'s [ordination module](http://scikit-bio.org/maths.stats.ordination.html)."

PCoA, which is what we've been working with, performs ordination with a distance matrix as input. PCA on the other hand performs ordination with sample by observation count data, such as the OTU tables that we've been working with, as input. It achieves this by computing Euclidean distance (see [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean.html#scipy.spatial.distance.euclidean)) between the samples and then running PCoA. So, if your distance metric is Euclidean, PCA and PCoA are the same. In practice however, we want to be able to use distance metrics that work better for studying biological diversity, such as Bray-Curtis or UniFrac. Therefore we typically compute distances with whatever metric we want, and then run PCoA."
